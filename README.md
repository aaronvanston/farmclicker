# farmclicker

Farmclicker is an idle clicker game based on gathering/selling resources. This style of games resembles the likes of [Cookie clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) or [Clicking bad](http://clickingbad.nullism.com/).

This project uses `react` + `redux` for the view and state management.

## Motivation around the game

I wanted to build a complex version of the tradition idle clicker game. Involving multiple resources (eggs, milk, wheat etc) that can work together and combine to produce complex items to sell. Eventually with enough items, a small industry could be formed producing and selling a variety of produce.

## Build instructions

To run farmclicker locally, clone the repo and run the following:

```bash
  yarn install # or npm install

  yarn start # or npm start
```

# Project roadmap

This game is a work-in-progress, things will be added progressively. To see whats coming up next, check out the [GitHub project for farmclicker](https://github.com/aaronvanston/farmclicker/projects/1).
